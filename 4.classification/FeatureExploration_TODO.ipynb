    "This notebook explores feature engineering for text classification.  Your task is to create two new feature functions (like `dictionary_feature` and `unigram_feature` below), and include them in the `build_features` function.  A check grade will be given to generic features that apply across arbitrary text classification problems (e.g., a feature for bigrams); check+ will be given for at least one feature that reveals your own understanding of your data. What features do you think will help for your particular problem? Your grade is *not* tied to whether accuracy goes up or down, so be creative!  You are free to read in any other external resources you like (dictionaries, document metadata, etc.)"
