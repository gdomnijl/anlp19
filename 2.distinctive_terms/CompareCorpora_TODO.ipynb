    "Simply analyzing the difference in relative frequencies has a number of downsides: 1.) As Monroe et al (2009) points out (and we can see here as well), it tends to emphasize high-frequency words (be sure you understand why).  2.) We're not measuring whether a difference is statistically meaningful or just due to chance; the $\\chi^2$ test is one method (described in Kilgarriff 2001 and in the context of collocations in Manning and Schuetze [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/promo/colloc.pdf)) that addresses the desideratum of finding statistically significant terms, but it too has another downside: 3.) Simply counting up the total number of mentions of a term doesn't account for the \"burstiness\" of language -- if we see the word \"Dracula\" in a text, we're probably going to see it again in that same text.  The occurrence of words are not independent random events; they are tightly coupled with each other. If we're trying to understanding the robust differences between two corpora, we might prefer to prioritize words that show up more frequently *everywhere* in corpus A (but not in corpus B) over those that show up only very frequently within narrow slice of A (such as one text in a genre, one chapter in a book, or one speaker when measuring the differences between policital parties)."
